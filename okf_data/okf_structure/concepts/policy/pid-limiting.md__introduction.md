Kubernetes allow you to limit the number of process IDs (PIDs) that a
Pod can use.
You can also reserve a number of allocatable PIDs for each node
for use by the operating system and daemons (rather than by Pods).

Process IDs (PIDs) are a fundamental resource on nodes. It is trivial to hit the
task limit without hitting any other resource limits, which can then cause
instability to a host machine.

Cluster administrators require mechanisms to ensure that Pods running in the
cluster cannot induce PID exhaustion that prevents host daemons (such as the
kubelet or
kube-proxy,
and potentially also the container runtime) from running.
In addition, it is important to ensure that PIDs are limited among Pods in order
to ensure they have limited impact on other workloads on the same node.

On certain Linux installations, the operating system sets the PIDs limit to a low default,
such as `32768`. Consider raising the value of `/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max`.

You can configure a kubelet to limit the number of PIDs a given Pod can consume.
For example, if your node's host OS is set to use a maximum of `262144` PIDs and
expect to host less than `250` Pods, one can give each Pod a budget of `1000`
PIDs to prevent using up that node's overall number of available PIDs. If the
admin wants to overcommit PIDs similar to CPU or memory, they may do so as well
with some additional risks. Either way, a single Pod will not be able to bring
the whole machine down. This kind of resource limiting helps to prevent simple
fork bombs from affecting operation of an entire cluster.

Per-Pod PID limiting allows administrators to protect one Pod from another, but
does not ensure that all Pods scheduled onto that host are unable to impact the node overall.
Per-Pod limiting also does not protect the node agents themselves from PID exhaustion.

You can also reserve an amount of PIDs for node overhead, separate from the
allocation to Pods. This is similar to how you can reserve CPU, memory, or other
resources for use by the operating system and other facilities outside of Pods
and their containers.

PID limiting is an important sibling to compute
resource requests
and limits. However, you specify it in a different way: rather than defining a
Pod's resource limit in the `.spec` for a Pod, you configure the limit as a
setting on the kubelet. Pod-defined PID limits are not currently supported.

This means that the limit that applies to a Pod may be different depending on
where the Pod is scheduled. To make things simple, it's easiest if all Nodes use
the same PID resource limits and reservations.
