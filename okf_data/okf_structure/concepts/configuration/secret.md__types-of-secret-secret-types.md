When creating a Secret, you can specify its type using the `type` field of
the Secret
resource, or certain equivalent `kubectl` command line flags (if available).
The Secret type is used to facilitate programmatic handling of the Secret data.

Kubernetes provides several built-in types for some common usage scenarios.
These types vary in terms of the validations performed and the constraints
Kubernetes imposes on them.

| Built-in Type                         | Usage                                   |
| ------------------------------------- |---------------------------------------- |
| `Opaque`                              | arbitrary user-defined data            |
| `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` | ServiceAccount token                    |
| `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`             | serialized `~/.dockercfg` file          |
| `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`      | serialized `~/.docker/config.json` file |
| `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`            | credentials for basic authentication    |
| `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`              | credentials for SSH authentication      |
| `kubernetes.io/tls`                   | data for a TLS client or server         |
| `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token`       | bootstrap token data                    |

You can define and use your own Secret type by assigning a non-empty string as the
`type` value for a Secret object (an empty string is treated as an `Opaque` type).

Kubernetes doesn't impose any constraints on the type name. However, if you
are using one of the built-in types, you must meet all the requirements defined
for that type.

If you are defining a type of Secret that's for public use, follow the convention
and structure the Secret type to have your domain name before the name, separated
by a `/`. For example: `cloud-hosting.example.net/cloud-api-credentials`.

### Opaque Secrets

`Opaque` is the default Secret type if you don't explicitly specify a type in
a Secret manifest. When you create a Secret using `kubectl`, you must use the
`generic` subcommand to indicate an `Opaque` Secret type. For example, the
following command creates an empty Secret of type `Opaque`:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic empty-secret
kubectl get secret empty-secret
```

The output looks like:

```
NAME           TYPE     DATA   AGE
empty-secret   Opaque   0      2m6s
```

The `DATA` column shows the number of data items stored in the Secret.
In this case, `0` means you have created an empty Secret.

### ServiceAccount token Secrets

A `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` type of Secret is used to store a
token credential that identifies a
ServiceAccount. This
is a legacy mechanism that provides long-lived ServiceAccount credentials to
Pods.

In Kubernetes v1.22 and later, the recommended approach is to obtain a
short-lived, automatically rotating ServiceAccount token by using the
`TokenRequest`
API instead. You can get these short-lived tokens using the following methods:

* Call the `TokenRequest` API either directly or by using an API client like
  `kubectl`. For example, you can use the
  `kubectl create token`
  command.
* Request a mounted token in a
  projected volume
  in your Pod manifest. Kubernetes creates the token and mounts it in the Pod.
  The token is automatically invalidated when the Pod that it's mounted in is
  deleted. For details, see
  Launch a Pod using service account token projection.

You should only create a ServiceAccount token Secret
if you can't use the `TokenRequest` API to obtain a token,
and the security exposure of persisting a non-expiring token credential
in a readable API object is acceptable to you. For instructions, see
Manually create a long-lived API token for a ServiceAccount.

When using this Secret type, you need to ensure that the
`kubernetes.io/service-account.name` annotation is set to an existing
ServiceAccount name. If you are creating both the ServiceAccount and
the Secret objects, you should create the ServiceAccount object first.

After the Secret is created, a Kubernetes controller
fills in some other fields such as the `kubernetes.io/service-account.uid` annotation, and the
`token` key in the `data` field, which is populated with an authentication token.

The following example configuration declares a ServiceAccount token Secret:

After creating the Secret, wait for Kubernetes to populate the `token` key in the `data` field.

See the ServiceAccount
documentation for more information on how ServiceAccounts work.
You can also check the `automountServiceAccountToken` field and the
`serviceAccountName` field of the
`Pod`
for information on referencing ServiceAccount credentials from within Pods.

### Docker config Secrets

If you are creating a Secret to store credentials for accessing a container image registry,
you must use one of the following `type` values for that Secret:

- `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`: store a serialized `~/.dockercfg` which is the
  legacy format for configuring Docker command line. The Secret
  `data` field contains a `.dockercfg` key whose value is the content of a
  base64 encoded `~/.dockercfg` file.
- `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`: store a serialized JSON that follows the
  same format rules as the `~/.docker/config.json` file, which is a new format
  for `~/.dockercfg`. The Secret `data` field must contain a
  `.dockerconfigjson` key for which the value is the content of a base64
  encoded `~/.docker/config.json` file.

Below is an example for a `kubernetes.io/dockercfg` type of Secret:

If you do not want to perform the base64 encoding, you can choose to use the
`stringData` field instead.

When you create Docker config Secrets using a manifest, the API
server checks whether the expected key exists in the `data` field, and
it verifies if the value provided can be parsed as a valid JSON. The API
server doesn't validate if the JSON actually is a Docker config file.

You can also use `kubectl` to create a Secret for accessing a container
registry, such as when you don't have a Docker configuration file:

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry secret-tiger-docker \
  --docker-email=tiger@acme.example \
  --docker-username=tiger \
  --docker-password=pass1234 \
  --docker-server=my-registry.example:5000
```

This command creates a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`.

Retrieve the `.data.dockerconfigjson` field from that new Secret and decode the
data:

```shell
kubectl get secret secret-tiger-docker -o jsonpath='{.data.*}' | base64 -d
```

The output is equivalent to the following JSON document (which is also a valid
Docker configuration file):

```json
{
  "auths": {
    "my-registry.example:5000": {
      "username": "tiger",
      "password": "pass1234",
      "email": "tiger@acme.example",
      "auth": "dGlnZXI6cGFzczEyMzQ="
    }
  }
}
```

The `auth` value there is base64 encoded; it is obscured but not secret.
Anyone who can read that Secret can learn the registry access bearer token.

It is suggested to use credential providers to dynamically and securely provide pull secrets on-demand.

### Basic authentication Secret

The `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` type is provided for storing credentials needed
for basic authentication. When using this Secret type, the `data` field of the
Secret must contain one of the following two keys:

- `username`: the user name for authentication
- `password`: the password or token for authentication

Both values for the above two keys are base64 encoded strings. You can
alternatively provide the clear text content using the `stringData` field in the
Secret manifest.

The following manifest is an example of a basic authentication Secret:

The `stringData` field for a Secret does not work well with server-side apply.

The basic authentication Secret type is provided only for convenience.
You can create an `Opaque` type for credentials used for basic authentication.
However, using the defined and public Secret type (`kubernetes.io/basic-auth`) helps other
people to understand the purpose of your Secret, and sets a convention for what key names
to expect.

### SSH authentication Secrets

The builtin type `kubernetes.io/ssh-auth` is provided for storing data used in
SSH authentication. When using this Secret type, you will have to specify a
`ssh-privatekey` key-value pair in the `data` (or `stringData`) field
as the SSH credential to use.

The following manifest is an example of a Secret used for SSH public/private
key authentication:

The SSH authentication Secret type is provided only for convenience.
You can create an `Opaque` type for credentials used for SSH authentication.
However, using the defined and public Secret type (`kubernetes.io/ssh-auth`) helps other
people to understand the purpose of your Secret, and sets a convention for what key names
to expect.
The Kubernetes API verifies that the required keys are set for a Secret of this type.

SSH private keys do not establish trusted communication between an SSH client and
host server on their own. A secondary means of establishing trust is needed to
mitigate "man in the middle" attacks, such as a `known_hosts` file added to a ConfigMap.

### TLS Secrets

The `kubernetes.io/tls` Secret type is for storing
a certificate and its associated key that are typically used for TLS.

One common use for TLS Secrets is to configure encryption in transit for
an Ingress, but you can also use it
with other resources or directly in your workload.
When using this type of Secret, the `tls.key` and the `tls.crt` key must be provided
in the `data` (or `stringData`) field of the Secret configuration, although the API
server doesn't actually validate the values for each key.

As an alternative to using `stringData`, you can use the `data` field to provide
the base64 encoded certificate and private key. For details, see
Constraints on Secret names and data.

The following YAML contains an example config for a TLS Secret:

The TLS Secret type is provided only for convenience.
You can create an `Opaque` type for credentials used for TLS authentication.
However, using the defined and public Secret type (`kubernetes.io/tls`)
helps ensure the consistency of Secret format in your project. The API server
verifies if the required keys are set for a Secret of this type.

To create a TLS Secret using `kubectl`, use the `tls` subcommand:

```shell
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret \
  --cert=path/to/cert/file \
  --key=path/to/key/file
```

The public/private key pair must exist before hand. The public key certificate for `--cert` must be .PEM encoded
and must match the given private key for `--key`.

### Bootstrap token Secrets

The `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token` Secret type is for
tokens used during the node bootstrap process. It stores tokens used to sign
well-known ConfigMaps.

A bootstrap token Secret is usually created in the `kube-system` namespace and
named in the form `bootstrap-token-<token-id>` where `<token-id>` is a 6 character
string of the token ID.

As a Kubernetes manifest, a bootstrap token Secret might look like the
following:

A bootstrap token Secret has the following keys specified under `data`:

- `token-id`: A random 6 character string as the token identifier. Required.
- `token-secret`: A random 16 character string as the actual token Secret. Required.
- `description`: A human-readable string that describes what the token is
  used for. Optional.
- `expiration`: An absolute UTC time using RFC3339 specifying when the token
  should be expired. Optional.
- `usage-bootstrap-<usage>`: A boolean flag indicating additional usage for
  the bootstrap token.
- `auth-extra-groups`: A comma-separated list of group names that will be
  authenticated as in addition to the `system:bootstrappers` group.

You can alternatively provide the values in the `stringData` field of the Secret
without base64 encoding them:

The `stringData` field for a Secret does not work well with server-side apply.
