When the kubelet starts a container as part of a Pod, the kubelet passes that container's
requests and limits for memory and CPU to the container runtime.

On Linux, the container runtime typically configures
kernel cgroups that apply and enforce the
limits you defined.

- The CPU limit defines a hard ceiling on how much CPU time the container can use.
  During each scheduling interval (time slice), the Linux kernel checks to see if this
  limit is exceeded; if so, the kernel waits before allowing that cgroup to resume execution.
- The CPU request typically defines a weighting. If several different containers (cgroups)
  want to run on a contended system, workloads with larger CPU requests are allocated more
  CPU time than workloads with small requests.
- The memory request is mainly used during (Kubernetes) Pod scheduling. On a node that uses
  cgroups v2, the container runtime might use the memory request as a hint to set
  `memory.min` and `memory.low`.
- The memory limit defines a memory limit for that cgroup. If the container tries to
  allocate more memory than this limit, the Linux kernel out-of-memory subsystem activates
  and, typically, intervenes by stopping one of the processes in the container that tried
  to allocate memory. If that process is the container's PID 1, and the container is marked
  as restartable, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- The memory limit for the Pod or container can also apply to pages in memory backed
  volumes, such as an `emptyDir`. The kubelet tracks `tmpfs` emptyDir volumes as container
  memory use, rather than as local ephemeral storage.
  When using memory backed `emptyDir`,
  be sure to check the notes below.

If a container exceeds its memory request and the node that it runs on becomes short of
memory overall, it is likely that the Pod the container belongs to will be
evicted.

A container might or might not be allowed to exceed its CPU limit for extended periods of time.
However, container runtimes don't terminate Pods or containers for excessive CPU usage.

To determine whether a container cannot be scheduled or is being killed due to resource limits,
see the Troubleshooting section.

### Resizing container resources

After creating a Pod, you may need to adjust its CPU or memory resources based on
actual usage patterns. Kubernetes provides two approaches for resizing Pod resources:

#### In-place resize {#pod-resize-inplace}

You can modify the CPU and memory `requests` and `limits` of containers
in a running Pod without recreating it. This is called _in-place Pod vertical scaling_
or _in-place Pod resize_. To perform an in-place resize, update the container's resource
specifications using the Pod's `/resize` subresource. You can control whether a container
restart is required by setting the `resizePolicy` field in the container specification.

In-place resize currently applies to container-level resources. For resizing Pod-level
resources, see Resize Pod CPU and Memory Resources.

#### Resizing by launching replacement Pods

The cloud native approach to changing a Pod's resources is to update the Pod template
in the workload object (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet) and let the workload's
controller replace Pods with new ones that have the updated resources. This approach
works with any Kubernetes version and can change any Pod specification.

For more details about Pod resizing, see Resizing Pods.
For detailed instructions on in-place resize, see
Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers.
You can also use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler
to automatically manage Pod resource recommendations.

### Monitoring compute & memory resource usage

The kubelet reports the resource usage of a Pod as part of the Pod
`status`.

If optional tools for monitoring
are available in your cluster, then Pod resource usage can be retrieved either
from the Metrics API
directly or from your monitoring tools.

### Considerations for memory backed `emptyDir` volumes {#memory-backed-emptydir}

If you do not specify a `sizeLimit` for an `emptyDir` volume, that volume may
consume up to that pod's memory limit (`Pod.spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`).
If you do not set a memory limit, the pod has no upper bound on memory consumption,
and can consume all available memory on the node. Kubernetes schedules pods based
on resource requests (`Pod.spec.containers[].resources.requests`) and will not
consider memory usage above the request when deciding if another pod can fit on
a given node. This can result in a denial of service and cause the OS to do
out-of-memory (OOM) handling. It is possible to create any number of `emptyDir`s
that could potentially consume all available memory on the node, making OOM
more likely.

From the perspective of memory management, there are some similarities between
when a process uses memory as a work area and when using memory-backed
`emptyDir`. But when using memory as a volume, like memory-backed `emptyDir`,
there are additional points below that you should be careful of:

* Files stored on a memory-backed volume are almost entirely managed by the
  user application. Unlike when used as a work area for a process, you can not
  rely on things like language-level garbage collection.
* The purpose of writing files to a volume is to save data or pass it between
  applications. Neither Kubernetes nor the OS may automatically delete files
  from a volume, so memory used by those files can not be reclaimed when the
  system or the pod are under memory pressure.
* A memory-backed `emptyDir` is useful because of its performance, but memory
  is generally much smaller in size and much higher in cost than other storage
  media, such as disks or SSDs. Using large amounts of memory for `emptyDir`
  volumes may affect the normal operation of your pod or of the whole node,
  so should be used carefully.

If you are administering a cluster or namespace, you can also set
ResourceQuota that limits memory use;
you may also want to define a LimitRange
for additional enforcement.
If you specify a `spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory` for each Pod,
then the maximum size of an `emptyDir` volume will be the pod's memory limit.

As an alternative, a cluster administrator can enforce size limits for
`emptyDir` volumes in new Pods using a policy mechanism such as
ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.
