If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and
allowed) for a container to use more resource than its `request` for that resource specifies.

For example, if you set a `memory` request of 256 MiB for a container, and that container is in
a Pod scheduled to a Node with 8GiB of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use
more RAM.

Limits are a different story. Both `cpu` and `memory` limits are applied by the kubelet (and
container runtime),
and are ultimately enforced by the kernel. On Linux nodes, the Linux kernel
enforces limits with
cgroups.
The behavior of `cpu` and `memory` limit enforcement is slightly different.

`cpu` limits are enforced by CPU throttling. When a container approaches
its `cpu` limit, the kernel will restrict access to the CPU corresponding to the
container's limit. Thus, a `cpu` limit is a hard limit the kernel enforces.
Containers may not use more CPU than is specified in their `cpu` limit.

`memory` limits are enforced by the kernel with out of memory (OOM) kills. When
a container uses more than its `memory` limit, the kernel may terminate it. However,
terminations only happen when the kernel detects memory pressure. Thus, a
container that over allocates memory may not be immediately killed. This means
`memory` limits are enforced reactively. A container may use more memory than
its `memory` limit, but if it does, it may get killed.

There is an alpha feature `MemoryQoS` which adds memory throttling and optional
tiered memory reservation on Linux nodes using cgroup v2. For details, see
Memory QoS with cgroup v2.

If you specify a limit for a resource, but do not specify any request, and no admission-time
mechanism has applied a default request for that resource, then Kubernetes copies the limit
you specified and uses it as the requested value for the resource.
