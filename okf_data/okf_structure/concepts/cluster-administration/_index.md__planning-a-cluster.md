See the guides in Setup for examples of how to plan, set up, and configure
Kubernetes clusters. The solutions listed in this article are called *distros*.

Not all distros are actively maintained. Choose distros which have been tested with a recent
version of Kubernetes.

Before choosing a guide, here are some considerations:

- Do you want to try out Kubernetes on your computer, or do you want to build a high-availability,
  multi-node cluster? Choose distros best suited for your needs.
- Will you be using **a hosted Kubernetes cluster**, such as
  Google Kubernetes Engine, or **hosting your own cluster**?
- Will your cluster be **on-premises**, or **in the cloud (IaaS)**? Kubernetes does not directly
  support hybrid clusters. Instead, you can set up multiple clusters.
- **If you are configuring Kubernetes on-premises**, consider which
  networking model fits best.
- Will you be running Kubernetes on **"bare metal" hardware** or on **virtual machines (VMs)**?
- Do you **want to run a cluster**, or do you expect to do **active development of Kubernetes project code**?
  If the latter, choose an actively-developed distro. Some distros only use binary releases, but
  offer a greater variety of choices.
- Familiarize yourself with the components needed to run a cluster.
