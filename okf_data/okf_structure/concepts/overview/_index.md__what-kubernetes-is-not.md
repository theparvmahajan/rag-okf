Kubernetes is not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS (Platform as a Service) system.
Since Kubernetes operates at the container level rather than at the hardware level,
it provides some generally applicable features common to PaaS offerings, such as
deployment, scaling, load balancing, and lets users integrate their logging, monitoring,
and alerting solutions. However, Kubernetes is not monolithic, and these default solutions
are optional and pluggable. Kubernetes provides the building blocks for building developer
platforms, but preserves user choice and flexibility where it is important.

Kubernetes:

* Does not limit the types of applications supported. Kubernetes aims to support an
  extremely diverse variety of workloads, including stateless, stateful, and data-processing
  workloads. If an application can run in a container, it should run great on Kubernetes.
* Does not deploy source code and does not build your application. Continuous Integration,
  Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows are determined by organization cultures and
  preferences as well as technical requirements.
* Does not provide application-level services, such as middleware (for example, message buses),
  data-processing frameworks (for example, Spark), databases (for example, MySQL), caches, nor
  cluster storage systems (for example, Ceph) as built-in services. Such components can run on
  Kubernetes, and/or can be accessed by applications running on Kubernetes through portable
  mechanisms, such as the Open Service Broker.
* Does not dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It provides some integrations
  as proof of concept, and mechanisms to collect and export metrics.
* Does not provide nor mandate a configuration language/system (for example, Jsonnet). It provides
  a declarative API that may be targeted by arbitrary forms of declarative specifications.
* Does not provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management,
  or self-healing systems.
* Additionally, Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need
  for orchestration. The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow:
  first do A, then B, then C. In contrast, Kubernetes comprises a set of independent, composable
  control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state.
  It shouldn't matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. This
  results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.
