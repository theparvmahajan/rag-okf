You can use either labels or annotations to attach metadata to Kubernetes
objects. Labels can be used to select objects and to find
collections of objects that satisfy certain conditions. In contrast, annotations
are not used to identify and select objects. The metadata
in an annotation can be small or large, structured or unstructured, and can
include characters not permitted by labels. It is possible to use labels as 
well as annotations in the metadata of the same object.

Annotations, like labels, are key/value maps:

```json
"metadata": {
  "annotations": {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2"
  }
}
```

The keys and the values in the map must be strings. In other words, you cannot use
numeric, boolean, list or other types for either the keys or the values.

Here are some examples of information that could be recorded in annotations:

* Fields managed by a declarative configuration layer. Attaching these fields
  as annotations distinguishes them from default values set by clients or
  servers, and from auto-generated fields and fields set by
  auto-sizing or auto-scaling systems.

* Build, release, or image information like timestamps, release IDs, git branch,
  PR numbers, image hashes, and registry address.

* Pointers to logging, monitoring, analytics, or audit repositories.

* Client library or tool information that can be used for debugging purposes:
  for example, name, version, and build information.

* User or tool/system provenance information, such as URLs of related objects
  from other ecosystem components.

* Lightweight rollout tool metadata: for example, config or checkpoints.

* Phone or pager numbers of persons responsible, or directory entries that
  specify where that information can be found, such as a team web site.

* Directives from the end-user to the implementations to modify behavior or
  engage non-standard features.

Instead of using annotations, you could store this type of information in an
external database or directory, but that would make it much harder to produce
shared client libraries and tools for deployment, management, introspection,
and the like.
