Ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different
configuration. Each Ingress should specify a class, a reference to an
IngressClass resource that contains additional configuration including the name
of the controller that should implement the class.

The `.spec.parameters` field of an IngressClass lets you reference another
resource that provides configuration related to that IngressClass.

The specific type of parameters to use depends on the ingress controller
that you specify in the `.spec.controller` field of the IngressClass.

### IngressClass scope

Depending on your ingress controller, you may be able to use parameters
that you set cluster-wide, or just for one namespace.

The default scope for IngressClass parameters is cluster-wide.

If you set the `.spec.parameters` field and don't set
`.spec.parameters.scope`, or if you set `.spec.parameters.scope` to
`Cluster`, then the IngressClass refers to a cluster-scoped resource.
The `kind` (in combination the `apiGroup`) of the parameters
refers to a cluster-scoped API (possibly a custom resource), and
the `name` of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped
resource for that API.

For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-1
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # The parameters for this IngressClass are specified in a
    # ClusterIngressParameter (API group k8s.example.net) named
    # "external-config-1". This definition tells Kubernetes to
    # look for a cluster-scoped parameter resource.
    scope: Cluster
    apiGroup: k8s.example.net
    kind: ClusterIngressParameter
    name: external-config-1
```

If you set the `.spec.parameters` field and set
`.spec.parameters.scope` to `Namespace`, then the IngressClass refers
to a namespaced-scoped resource. You must also set the `namespace`
field within `.spec.parameters` to the namespace that contains
the parameters you want to use.

The `kind` (in combination the `apiGroup`) of the parameters
refers to a namespaced API (for example: ConfigMap), and
the `name` of the parameters identifies a specific resource
in the namespace you specified in `namespace`.

Namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the
configuration (for example: load balancer settings, API gateway definition)
that is used for a workload. If you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either:

- the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every
  time there's a new configuration change being applied.
- the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as
  RBAC roles and bindings, that let
  the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.

The IngressClass API itself is always cluster-scoped.

Here is an example of an IngressClass that refers to parameters that are
namespaced:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-2
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # The parameters for this IngressClass are specified in an
    # IngressParameter (API group k8s.example.com) named "external-config",
    # that's in the "external-configuration" namespace.
    scope: Namespace
    apiGroup: k8s.example.com
    kind: IngressParameter
    namespace: external-configuration
    name: external-config
```

### Deprecated annotation

Before the IngressClass resource and `ingressClassName` field were added in
Kubernetes 1.18, Ingress classes were specified with a
`kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation on the Ingress. This annotation was
never formally defined, but was widely supported by Ingress controllers.

The newer `ingressClassName` field on Ingresses is a replacement for that
annotation, but is not a direct equivalent. While the annotation was generally
used to reference the name of the Ingress controller that should implement the
Ingress, the field is a reference to an IngressClass resource that contains
additional Ingress configuration, including the name of the Ingress controller.

### Default IngressClass {#default-ingress-class}

You can mark a particular IngressClass as default for your cluster. Setting the
`ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation to `true` on an
IngressClass resource will ensure that new Ingresses without an
`ingressClassName` field specified will be assigned this default IngressClass.

If you have more than one IngressClass marked as the default for your cluster,
the admission controller prevents creating new Ingress objects that don't have
an `ingressClassName` specified. You can resolve this by ensuring that at most 1
IngressClass is marked as default in your cluster.

Start by defining a
default IngressClass. It is recommended though, to specify the default
IngressClass:
