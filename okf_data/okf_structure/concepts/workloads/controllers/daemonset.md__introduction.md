A _DaemonSet_ ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.  As nodes are added to the
cluster, Pods are added to them.  As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage
collected.  Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

- running a cluster storage daemon on every node
- running a logs collection daemon on every node
- running a node monitoring daemon on every node

In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon.
A more complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, but with
different flags and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.
