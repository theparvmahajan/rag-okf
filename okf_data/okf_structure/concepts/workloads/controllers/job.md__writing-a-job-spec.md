As with all other Kubernetes config, a Job needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields.

When the control plane creates new Pods for a Job, the `.metadata.name` of the
Job is part of the basis for naming those Pods. The name of a Job must be a valid
DNS subdomain
value, but this can produce unexpected results for the Pod hostnames. For best compatibility,
the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a
DNS label.
Even when the name is a DNS subdomain, the name must be no longer than 63
characters.

A Job also needs a `.spec` section.

### Job Labels

Job labels will have `batch.kubernetes.io/` prefix for `job-name` and `controller-uid`.

### Pod Template

The `.spec.template` is the only required field of the `.spec`.

The `.spec.template` is a pod template.
It has exactly the same schema as a Pod,
except it is nested and does not have an `apiVersion` or `kind`.

In addition to required fields for a Pod, a pod template in a Job must specify appropriate
labels (see pod selector) and an appropriate restart policy.

Only a `RestartPolicy`
equal to `Never` or `OnFailure` is allowed.

### Pod selector

The `.spec.selector` field is optional. In almost all cases you should not specify it.
See section specifying your own pod selector.

### Parallel execution for Jobs {#parallel-jobs}

There are three main types of task suitable to run as a Job:

1. Non-parallel Jobs
   - normally, only one Pod is started, unless the Pod fails.
   - the Job is complete as soon as its Pod terminates successfully.
1. Parallel Jobs with a *fixed completion count*:
   - specify a non-zero positive value for `.spec.completions`.
   - the Job represents the overall task, and is complete when there are `.spec.completions` successful Pods.
   - when using `.spec.completionMode="Indexed"`, each Pod gets a different index in the range 0 to `.spec.completions-1`.
1. Parallel Jobs with a *work queue*:
   - do not specify `.spec.completions`, default to `.spec.parallelism`.
   - the Pods must coordinate amongst themselves or an external service to determine
     what each should work on. For example, a Pod might fetch a batch of up to N items from the work queue.
   - each Pod is independently capable of determining whether or not all its peers are done,
     and thus that the entire Job is done.
   - when _any_ Pod from the Job terminates with success, no new Pods are created.
   - once at least one Pod has terminated with success and all Pods are terminated,
     then the Job is completed with success.
   - once any Pod has exited with success, no other Pod should still be doing any work
     for this task or writing any output. They should all be in the process of exiting.

For a _non-parallel_ Job, you can leave both `.spec.completions` and `.spec.parallelism` unset.
When both are unset, both are defaulted to 1.

For a _fixed completion count_ Job, you should set `.spec.completions` to the number of completions needed.
You can set `.spec.parallelism`, or leave it unset and it will default to 1.

For a _work queue_ Job, you must leave `.spec.completions` unset, and set `.spec.parallelism` to
a non-negative integer.

For more information about how to make use of the different types of job,
see the job patterns section.

#### Controlling parallelism

The requested parallelism (`.spec.parallelism`) can be set to any non-negative value.
If it is unspecified, it defaults to 1.
If it is specified as 0, then the Job is effectively paused until it is increased.

Actual parallelism (number of pods running at any instant) may be more or less than requested
parallelism, for a variety of reasons:

- For _fixed completion count_ Jobs, the actual number of pods running in parallel will not exceed the number of
  remaining completions. Higher values of `.spec.parallelism` are effectively ignored.
- For _work queue_ Jobs, no new Pods are started after any Pod has succeeded -- remaining Pods are allowed to complete, however.
- If the Job controller has not had time to react.
- If the Job controller failed to create Pods for any reason (lack of `ResourceQuota`, lack of permission, etc.),
  then there may be fewer pods than requested.
- The Job controller may throttle new Pod creation due to excessive previous pod failures in the same Job.
- When a Pod is gracefully shut down, it takes time to stop.

### Completion mode

Jobs with _fixed completion count_ - that is, jobs that have non null
`.spec.completions` - can have a completion mode that is specified in `.spec.completionMode`:

- `NonIndexed` (default): the Job is considered complete when there have been
  `.spec.completions` successfully completed Pods. In other words, each Pod
  completion is homologous to each other. Note that Jobs that have null
  `.spec.completions` are implicitly `NonIndexed`.
- `Indexed`: the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to
  `.spec.completions-1`. The index is available through four mechanisms:
  - The Pod annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index`.
  - The Pod label `batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index` (for v1.28 and later). Note
    the feature gate `PodIndexLabel` must be enabled to use this label, and it is enabled
    by default.
  - As part of the Pod hostname, following the pattern `$(job-name)-$(index)`.
    When you use an Indexed Job in combination with a
    Service, Pods within the Job can use
    the deterministic hostnames to address each other via DNS. For more information about
    how to configure this, see Job with Pod-to-Pod Communication.
  - From the containerized task, in the environment variable `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX`.
  
  The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
  for each index. For more information about how to use this mode, see
  Indexed Job for Parallel Processing with Static Work Assignment.

Although rare, more than one Pod could be started for the same index (due to various reasons such as node failures,
kubelet restarts, or Pod evictions). In this case, only the first Pod that completes successfully will
count towards the completion count and update the status of the Job. The other Pods that are running
or completed for the same index will be deleted by the Job controller once they are detected.
