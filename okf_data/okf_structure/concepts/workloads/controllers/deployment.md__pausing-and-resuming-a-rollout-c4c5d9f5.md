When you update a Deployment, or plan to, you can pause rollouts
for that Deployment before you trigger one or more updates. When
you're ready to apply those changes, you resume rollouts for the
Deployment. This approach allows you to
apply multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.

* For example, with a Deployment that was created:

  Get the Deployment details:
  ```shell
  kubectl get deploy
  ```
  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  nginx     3         3         3            3           1m
  ```
  Get the rollout status:
  ```shell
  kubectl get rs
  ```
  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
  nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         1m
  ```

* Pause by running the following command:
  ```shell
  kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
  ```

* Then update the image of the Deployment:
  ```shell
  kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.16.1
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
  ```

* Notice that no new rollout started:
  ```shell
  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  deployments "nginx"
  REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
  1   <none>
  ```
* Get the rollout status to verify that the existing ReplicaSet has not changed:
  ```shell
  kubectl get rs
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
  nginx-2142116321   3         3         3         2m
  ```

* You can make as many updates as you wish, for example, update the resources that will be used:
  ```shell
  kubectl set resources deployment/nginx-deployment -c=nginx --limits=cpu=200m,memory=512Mi
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resource requirements updated
  ```

  The initial state of the Deployment prior to pausing its rollout will continue its function, but new updates to
  the Deployment will not have any effect as long as the Deployment rollout is paused.

* Eventually, resume the Deployment rollout and observe a new ReplicaSet coming up with all the new updates:
  ```shell
  kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
  ```
* Watch the status of the rollout until it's done.
  ```shell
  kubectl get rs --watch
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
  nginx-2142116321   2         2         2         2m
  nginx-3926361531   2         2         0         6s
  nginx-3926361531   2         2         1         18s
  nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
  nginx-2142116321   1         2         2         2m
  nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
  nginx-3926361531   3         2         1         18s
  nginx-2142116321   1         1         1         2m
  nginx-3926361531   3         3         1         18s
  nginx-3926361531   3         3         2         19s
  nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
  nginx-2142116321   0         1         1         2m
  nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
  nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         20s
  ```
* Get the status of the latest rollout:
  ```shell
  kubectl get rs
  ```

  The output is similar to this:
  ```
  NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
  nginx-2142116321   0         0         0         2m
  nginx-3926361531   3         3         3         28s
  ```

You cannot rollback a paused Deployment until you resume it.
