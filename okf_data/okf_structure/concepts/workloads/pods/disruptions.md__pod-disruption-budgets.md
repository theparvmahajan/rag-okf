Kubernetes offers features to help you run highly available applications even when you
introduce frequent voluntary disruptions.

As an application owner, you can create a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) for each application.
A PDB limits the number of Pods of a replicated application that are down simultaneously from
voluntary disruptions. For example, a quorum-based application would
like to ensure that the number of replicas running is never brought below the
number needed for a quorum. A web front end might want to
ensure that the number of replicas serving load never falls below a certain
percentage of the total.

Cluster managers and hosting providers should use tools which
respect PodDisruptionBudgets by calling the Eviction API
instead of directly deleting pods or deployments.

For example, the `kubectl drain` subcommand lets you mark a node as going out of
service. When you run `kubectl drain`, the tool tries to evict all of the Pods on
the Node you're taking out of service. The eviction request that `kubectl` submits on
your behalf may be temporarily rejected, so the tool periodically retries all failed
requests until all Pods on the target node are terminated, or until a configurable timeout
is reached.

A PDB specifies the number of replicas that an application can tolerate having, relative to how
many it is intended to have.  For example, a Deployment which has a `.spec.replicas: 5` is
supposed to have 5 pods at any given time.  If its PDB allows for there to be 4 at a time,
then the Eviction API will allow voluntary disruption of one (but not two) pods at a time.

The group of pods that comprise the application is specified using a label selector, the same
as the one used by the application's controller (deployment, stateful-set, etc).

The "intended" number of pods is computed from the `.spec.replicas` of the workload resource
that is managing those pods. The control plane discovers the owning workload resource by
examining the `.metadata.ownerReferences` of the Pod.

Involuntary disruptions cannot be prevented by PDBs; however they
do count against the budget.

Pods which are deleted or unavailable due to a rolling upgrade to an application do count
against the disruption budget, but workload resources (such as Deployment and StatefulSet)
are not limited by PDBs when doing rolling upgrades. Instead, the handling of failures
during application updates is configured in the spec for the specific workload resource.

It is recommended to set `AlwaysAllow` Unhealthy Pod Eviction Policy
to your PodDisruptionBudgets to support eviction of misbehaving applications during a node drain.
The default behavior is to wait for the application pods to become healthy
before the drain can proceed.

When a pod is evicted using the eviction API, it is gracefully
terminated, honoring the
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` setting in its PodSpec.
