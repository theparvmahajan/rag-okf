Because init containers have separate images from app containers, they
have some advantages for start-up related code:

* Init containers can contain utilities or custom code for setup that are not present in an app
  image. For example, there is no need to make an image `FROM` another image just to use a tool like
  `sed`, `awk`, `python`, or `dig` during setup.
* The application image builder and deployer roles can work independently without
  the need to jointly build a single app image.
* Init containers can run with a different view of the filesystem than app containers in the
  same Pod. Consequently, they can be given access to
  Secrets that app containers cannot access.
* Because init containers run to completion before any app containers start, init containers offer
  a mechanism to block or delay app container startup until a set of preconditions are met. Once
  preconditions are met, all of the app containers in a Pod can start in parallel.
* Init containers can securely run utilities or custom code that would otherwise make an app
  container image less secure. By keeping unnecessary tools separate you can limit the attack
  surface of your app container image.

### Examples
Here are some ideas for how to use init containers:

* Wait for a Service to
  be created, using a shell one-line command like:
  ```shell
  for i in {1..100}; do sleep 1; if nslookup myservice; then exit 0; fi; done; exit 1
  ```

* Register this Pod with a remote server from the downward API with a command like:
  ```shell
  curl -X POST http://$MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_HOST:$MANAGEMENT_SERVICE_PORT/register -d 'instance=$(<POD_NAME>)&ip=$(<POD_IP>)'
  ```

* Wait for some time before starting the app container with a command like
  ```shell
  sleep 60
  ```

* Clone a Git repository into a Volume

* Place values into a configuration file and run a template tool to dynamically
  generate a configuration file for the main app container. For example,
  place the `POD_IP` value in a configuration and generate the main app
  configuration file using Jinja.

#### Init containers in use

This example defines a simple Pod that has two init containers.
The first waits for `myservice`, and the second waits for `mydb`. Once both
init containers complete, the Pod runs the app container from its `spec` section.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup myservice.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done"]
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup mydb.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done"]
```

You can start this Pod by running:

```shell
kubectl apply -f myapp.yaml
```
The output is similar to this:
```
pod/myapp-pod created
```

And check on its status with:
```shell
kubectl get -f myapp.yaml
```
The output is similar to this:
```
NAME        READY     STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
myapp-pod   0/1       Init:0/2   0          6m
```

or for more details:
```shell
kubectl describe -f myapp.yaml
```
The output is similar to this:
```

Namespace:     default

```

To see logs for the init containers in this Pod, run:
```shell
kubectl logs myapp-pod -c init-myservice # Inspect the first init container
kubectl logs myapp-pod -c init-mydb      # Inspect the second init container
```

At this point, those init containers will be waiting to discover Services named
`mydb` and `myservice`.

Here's a configuration you can use to make those Services appear:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mydb
spec:
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9377
```

To create the `mydb` and `myservice` services:

```shell
kubectl apply -f services.yaml
```
The output is similar to this:
```
service/myservice created
service/mydb created
```

You'll then see that those init containers complete, and that the `myapp-pod`
Pod moves into the Running state:

```shell
kubectl get -f myapp.yaml
```
The output is similar to this:
```
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myapp-pod   1/1       Running   0          9m
```

This simple example should provide some inspiration for you to create your own
init containers. What's next contains a link to a more detailed example.
