A Pod's `status` field is a
PodStatus
object, which has a `phase` field.

The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
lifecycle. The phase is not intended to be a comprehensive rollup of observations
of container or Pod state, nor is it intended to be a comprehensive state machine.

The number and meanings of Pod phase values are tightly guarded.
Other than what is documented here, nothing should be assumed about Pods that
have a given `phase` value.

Here are the possible values for `phase`:

Value       | Description
:-----------|:-----------
`Pending`   | The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes time a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network.
`Running`   | The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
`Succeeded` | All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
`Failed`    | All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system, and is not set for automatic restarting.
`Unknown`   | For some reason the state of the Pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the Pod should be running.

When a pod is failing to start repeatedly, `CrashLoopBackOff` may appear in the `Status` field of some kubectl commands.
Similarly, when a pod is being deleted, `Terminating` may appear in the `Status` field of some kubectl commands.

Make sure not to confuse _Status_, a kubectl display field for user intuition, with the pod's `phase`.
Pod phase is an explicit part of the Kubernetes data model and of the
Pod API. 

```
  NAMESPACE               NAME               READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  alessandras-namespace   alessandras-pod    0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   200        2d9h
```

A Pod is granted a term to terminate gracefully, which defaults to 30 seconds.
You can use the flag `--force` to terminate a Pod by force.

Since Kubernetes 1.27, the kubelet transitions deleted Pods to a terminal phase
(`Failed` or `Succeeded` depending on the exit statuses of the pod containers)
before their deletion from the API server, with two exceptions:

* static Pods (which are
managed directly by the kubelet and represented by mirror Pods) 
*  force-deleted
Pods
without a finalizer

If a node dies or is disconnected from the rest of the cluster, Kubernetes
applies a policy for setting the `phase` of all Pods on the lost node to Failed.
