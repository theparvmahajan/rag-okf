### Why isn't there a profile between Privileged and Baseline?

The three profiles defined here have a clear linear progression from most secure (Restricted) to least
secure (Privileged), and cover a broad set of workloads. Privileges required above the Baseline
policy are typically very application specific, so we do not offer a standard profile in this
niche. This is not to say that the privileged profile should always be used in this case, but that
policies in this space need to be defined on a case-by-case basis.

SIG Auth may reconsider this position in the future, should a clear need for other profiles arise.

### What's the difference between a security profile and a security context?

Security Contexts configure Pods and
Containers at runtime. Security contexts are defined as part of the Pod and container specifications
in the Pod manifest, and represent parameters to the container runtime.

Security profiles are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Context,
as well as other related parameters outside the Security Context. As of July 2021,
Pod Security Policies are deprecated in favor of the
built-in Pod Security Admission Controller.

### What about sandboxed Pods?

There is currently no API standard that controls whether a Pod is considered sandboxed or
not. Sandbox Pods may be identified by the use of a sandboxed runtime (such as gVisor or Kata
Containers), but there is no standard definition of what a sandboxed runtime is.

The protections necessary for sandboxed workloads can differ from others. For example, the need to
restrict privileged permissions is lessened when the workload is isolated from the underlying
kernel. This allows for workloads requiring heightened permissions to still be isolated.

Additionally, the protection of sandboxed workloads is highly dependent on the method of
sandboxing. As such, no single recommended profile is recommended for all sandboxed workloads.
