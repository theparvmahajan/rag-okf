Some of the things that you can use an operator to automate include:

* deploying an application on demand
* taking and restoring backups of that application's state
* handling upgrades of the application code alongside related changes such
  as database schemas or extra configuration settings
* publishing a Service to applications that don't support Kubernetes APIs to
  discover them
* simulating failure in all or part of your cluster to test its resilience
* choosing a leader for a distributed application without an internal
  member election process

What might an operator look like in more detail? Here's an example:

1. A custom resource named SampleDB, that you can configure into the cluster.
2. A Deployment that makes sure a Pod is running that contains the
   controller part of the operator.
3. A container image of the operator code.
4. Controller code that queries the control plane to find out what SampleDB
   resources are configured.
5. The core of the operator is code to tell the API server how to make
   reality match the configured resources.
   * If you add a new SampleDB, the operator sets up PersistentVolumeClaims
     to provide durable database storage, a StatefulSet to run SampleDB and
     a Job to handle initial configuration.
   * If you delete it, the operator takes a snapshot, then makes sure that
     the StatefulSet and Volumes are also removed.
6. The operator also manages regular database backups. For each SampleDB
   resource, the operator determines when to create a Pod that can connect
   to the database and take backups. These Pods would rely on a ConfigMap
   and / or a Secret that has database connection details and credentials.
7. Because the operator aims to provide robust automation for the resource
   it manages, there would be additional supporting code. For this example,
   code checks to see if the database is running an old version and, if so,
   creates Job objects that upgrade it for you.
