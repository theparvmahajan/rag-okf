Pod priority and preemption can have unwanted side effects. Here are some
examples of potential problems and ways to deal with them.

### Pods are preempted unnecessarily

Preemption removes existing Pods from a cluster under resource pressure to make
room for higher priority pending Pods. If you give high priorities to
certain Pods by mistake, these unintentionally high priority Pods may cause
preemption in your cluster. Pod priority is specified by setting the
`priorityClassName` field in the Pod's specification. The integer value for
priority is then resolved and populated to the `priority` field of `podSpec`.

To address the problem, you can change the `priorityClassName` for those Pods
to use lower priority classes, or leave that field empty. An empty
`priorityClassName` is resolved to zero by default.

When a Pod is preempted, there will be events recorded for the preempted Pod.
Preemption should happen only when a cluster does not have enough resources for
a Pod. In such cases, preemption happens only when the priority of the pending
Pod (preemptor) is higher than the victim Pods. Preemption must not happen when
there is no pending Pod, or when the pending Pods have equal or lower priority
than the victims. If preemption happens in such scenarios, please file an issue.

### Pods are preempted, but the preemptor is not scheduled

When pods are preempted, they receive their requested graceful termination
period, which is by default 30 seconds. If the victim Pods do not terminate within
this period, they are forcibly terminated. Once all the victims go away, the
preemptor Pod can be scheduled.

While the preemptor Pod is waiting for the victims to go away, a higher priority
Pod may be created that fits on the same Node. In this case, the scheduler will
schedule the higher priority Pod instead of the preemptor.

This is expected behavior: the Pod with the higher priority should take the place
of a Pod with a lower priority.

### Higher priority Pods are preempted before lower priority pods

The scheduler tries to find nodes that can run a pending Pod. If no node is
found, the scheduler tries to remove Pods with lower priority from an arbitrary
node in order to make room for the pending pod.
If a node with low priority Pods is not feasible to run the pending Pod, the scheduler
may choose another node with higher priority Pods (compared to the Pods on the
other node) for preemption. The victims must still have lower priority than the
preemptor Pod.

When there are multiple nodes available for preemption, the scheduler tries to
choose the node with a set of Pods with lowest priority. However, if such Pods
have PodDisruptionBudget that would be violated if they are preempted then the
scheduler may choose another node with higher priority Pods.

When multiple nodes exist for preemption and none of the above scenarios apply,
the scheduler chooses a node with the lowest priority.
