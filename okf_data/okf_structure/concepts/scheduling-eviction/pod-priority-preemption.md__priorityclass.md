A PriorityClass is a non-namespaced object that defines a mapping from a
priority class name to the integer value of the priority. The name is specified
in the `name` field of the PriorityClass object's metadata. The value is
specified in the required `value` field. The higher the value, the higher the
priority.
The name of a PriorityClass object must be a valid
DNS subdomain name,
and it cannot be prefixed with `system-`.

A PriorityClass object can have any 32-bit integer value smaller than or equal
to 1 billion. This means that the range of values for a PriorityClass object is
from -2147483648 to 1000000000 inclusive. Larger numbers are reserved for
built-in PriorityClasses that represent critical system Pods. A cluster
admin should create one PriorityClass object for each such mapping that they want.

PriorityClass also has two optional fields: `globalDefault` and `description`.
The `globalDefault` field indicates that the value of this PriorityClass should
be used for Pods without a `priorityClassName`. Only one PriorityClass with
`globalDefault` set to true can exist in the system. If there is no
PriorityClass with `globalDefault` set, the priority of Pods with no
`priorityClassName` is zero.

The `description` field is an arbitrary string. It is meant to tell users of the
cluster when they should use this PriorityClass.

### Notes about PodPriority and existing clusters

-   If you upgrade an existing cluster without this feature, the priority
    of your existing Pods is effectively zero.

-   Addition of a PriorityClass with `globalDefault` set to `true` does not
    change the priorities of existing Pods. The value of such a PriorityClass is
    used only for Pods created after the PriorityClass is added.

-   If you delete a PriorityClass, existing Pods that use the name of the
    deleted PriorityClass remain unchanged, but you cannot create more Pods that
    use the name of the deleted PriorityClass.

### Example PriorityClass

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000
globalDefault: false
description: "This priority class should be used for XYZ service pods only."
```
