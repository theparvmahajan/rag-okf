The CustomResourceDefinition API `versions` field can be used to support multiple versions of custom resources that you
have developed. Versions can have different schemas, and conversion webhooks can convert custom resources between versions.
Webhook conversions should follow the Kubernetes API conventions wherever applicable.
Specifically, See the API change documentation for a set of useful gotchas and suggestions.

In `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`, there was a `version` field instead of `versions`. The
`version` field is deprecated and optional, but if it is not empty, it must
match the first item in the `versions` field.

This example shows a CustomResourceDefinition with two versions. For the first
example, the assumption is all versions share the same schema with no conversion
between them. The comments in the YAML provide more context.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1

  # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: <plural>.<group>

    kind: CronTab
    # shortNames allow shorter string to match your resource on the CLI
    shortNames:
    - ct
```

You can save the CustomResourceDefinition in a YAML file, then use
`kubectl apply` to create it.

```shell
kubectl apply -f my-versioned-crontab.yaml
```

After creation, the API server starts to serve each enabled version at an HTTP
REST endpoint. In the above example, the API versions are available at
`/apis/example.com/v1beta1` and `/apis/example.com/v1`.

### Version priority

Regardless of the order in which versions are defined in a
CustomResourceDefinition, the version with the highest priority is used by
kubectl as the default version to access objects. The priority is determined
by parsing the _name_ field to determine the version number, the stability
(GA, Beta, or Alpha), and the sequence within that stability level.

The algorithm used for sorting the versions is designed to sort versions in the
same way that the Kubernetes project sorts Kubernetes versions. Versions start with a
`v` followed by a number, an optional `beta` or `alpha` designation, and
optional additional numeric versioning information. Broadly, a version string might look
like `v2` or `v2beta1`. Versions are sorted using the following algorithm:

- Entries that follow Kubernetes version patterns are sorted before those that
  do not.
- For entries that follow Kubernetes version patterns, the numeric portions of
  the version string is sorted largest to smallest.
- If the strings `beta` or `alpha` follow the first numeric portion, they sorted
  in that order, after the equivalent string without the `beta` or `alpha`
  suffix (which is presumed to be the GA version).
- If another number follows the `beta`, or `alpha`, those numbers are also
  sorted from largest to smallest.
- Strings that don't fit the above format are sorted alphabetically and the
  numeric portions are not treated specially. Notice that in the example below,
  `foo1` is sorted above `foo10`. This is different from the sorting of the
  numeric portion of entries that do follow the Kubernetes version patterns.

This might make sense if you look at the following sorted version list:

```none
- v10
- v2
- v1
- v11beta2
- v10beta3
- v3beta1
- v12alpha1
- v11alpha2
- foo1
- foo10
```

For the example in Specify multiple versions, the
version sort order is `v1`, followed by `v1beta1`. This causes the kubectl
command to use `v1` as the default version unless the provided object specifies
the version.

### Version deprecation

Starting in v1.19, a CustomResourceDefinition can indicate a particular version of the resource it defines is deprecated.
When API requests to a deprecated version of that resource are made, a warning message is returned in the API response as a header.
The warning message for each deprecated version of the resource can be customized if desired.

A customized warning message should indicate the deprecated API group, version, and kind,
and should indicate what API group, version, and kind should be used instead, if applicable.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: crontabs.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    plural: crontabs
    singular: crontab
    kind: CronTab
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: false
    # This indicates the v1alpha1 version of the custom resource is deprecated.
    # API requests to this version receive a warning header in the server response.
    deprecated: true
    # This overrides the default warning returned to API clients making v1alpha1 API requests.
    deprecationWarning: "example.com/v1alpha1 CronTab is deprecated; see http://example.com/v1alpha1-v1 for instructions to migrate to example.com/v1 CronTab"
    
    schema: ...
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    # This indicates the v1beta1 version of the custom resource is deprecated.
    # API requests to this version receive a warning header in the server response.
    # A default warning message is returned for this version.
    deprecated: true
    schema: ...
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
    schema: ...
```

```yaml
# Deprecated in v1.16 in favor of apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: crontabs.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    plural: crontabs
    singular: crontab
    kind: CronTab
  scope: Namespaced
  validation: ...
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: false
    # This indicates the v1alpha1 version of the custom resource is deprecated.
    # API requests to this version receive a warning header in the server response.
    deprecated: true
    # This overrides the default warning returned to API clients making v1alpha1 API requests.
    deprecationWarning: "example.com/v1alpha1 CronTab is deprecated; see http://example.com/v1alpha1-v1 for instructions to migrate to example.com/v1 CronTab"
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    # This indicates the v1beta1 version of the custom resource is deprecated.
    # API requests to this version receive a warning header in the server response.
    # A default warning message is returned for this version.
    deprecated: true
  - name: v1
    served: true
    storage: true
```

### Version removal

An older API version cannot be dropped from a CustomResourceDefinition manifest until existing stored data has been migrated to the newer API version for all clusters that served the older version of the custom resource, and the old version is removed from the `status.storedVersions` of the CustomResourceDefinition.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: crontabs.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  names:
    plural: crontabs
    singular: crontab
    kind: CronTab
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
  - name: v1beta1
    # This indicates the v1beta1 version of the custom resource is no longer served.
    # API requests to this version receive a not found error in the server response.
    served: false
    schema: ...
  - name: v1
    served: true
    # The new served version should be set as the storage version
    storage: true
    schema: ...
```
