The API server sets certain fields to default values in the live configuration if they are
not specified when the object is created.

Here's a configuration file for a Deployment. The file does not specify `strategy`:

Create the object using `kubectl apply`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/simple_deployment.yaml
```

Print the live configuration using `kubectl get`:

```shell
kubectl get -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/simple_deployment.yaml -o yaml
```

The output shows that the API server set several fields to default values in the live
configuration. These fields were not specified in the configuration file.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
# ...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  minReadySeconds: 5
  replicas: 1 # defaulted by apiserver
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate: # defaulted by apiserver - derived from strategy.type
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate # defaulted by apiserver
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.14.2
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent # defaulted by apiserver
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP # defaulted by apiserver
        resources: {} # defaulted by apiserver
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log # defaulted by apiserver
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst # defaulted by apiserver
      restartPolicy: Always # defaulted by apiserver
      securityContext: {} # defaulted by apiserver
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30 # defaulted by apiserver
# ...
```

In a patch request, defaulted fields are not re-defaulted unless they are explicitly cleared
as part of a patch request. This can cause unexpected behavior for
fields that are defaulted based
on the values of other fields. When the other fields are later changed,
the values defaulted from them will not be updated unless they are
explicitly cleared.

For this reason, it is recommended that certain fields defaulted
by the server are explicitly defined in the configuration file, even
if the desired values match the server defaults. This makes it
easier to recognize conflicting values that will not be re-defaulted
by the server.

**Example:**

```yaml
# last-applied-configuration
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# configuration file
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate # updated value
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# live configuration
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate # defaulted value
    rollingUpdate: # defaulted value derived from type
      maxSurge : 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# result after merge - ERROR!
spec:
  strategy:
    type: Recreate # updated value: incompatible with rollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate: # defaulted value: incompatible with "type: Recreate"
      maxSurge : 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Explanation:**

1. The user creates a Deployment without defining `strategy.type`.
2. The server defaults `strategy.type` to `RollingUpdate` and defaults the
   `strategy.rollingUpdate` values.
3. The user changes `strategy.type` to `Recreate`. The `strategy.rollingUpdate`
   values remain at their defaulted values, though the server expects them to be cleared.
   If the `strategy.rollingUpdate` values had been defined initially in the configuration file,
   it would have been more clear that they needed to be deleted.
4. Apply fails because `strategy.rollingUpdate` is not cleared. The `strategy.rollingupdate`
   field cannot be defined with a `strategy.type` of `Recreate`.

Recommendation: These fields should be explicitly defined in the object configuration file:

- Selectors and PodTemplate labels on workloads, such as Deployment, StatefulSet, Job, DaemonSet,
  ReplicaSet, and ReplicationController
- Deployment rollout strategy

### How to clear server-defaulted fields or fields set by other writers

Fields that do not appear in the configuration file can be cleared by
setting their values to `null` and then applying the configuration file.
For fields defaulted by the server, this triggers re-defaulting
the values.
