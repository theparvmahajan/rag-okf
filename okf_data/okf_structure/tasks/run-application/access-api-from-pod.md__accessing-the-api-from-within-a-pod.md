When accessing the API from within a Pod, locating and authenticating
to the API server are slightly different to the external client case.

The easiest way to use the Kubernetes API from a Pod is to use
one of the official client libraries. These
libraries can automatically discover the API server and authenticate.

### Using Official Client Libraries

From within a Pod, the recommended ways to connect to the Kubernetes API are:

- For a Go client, use the official
  Go client library.
  The `rest.InClusterConfig()` function handles API host discovery and authentication automatically.
  See an example here.

- For a Python client, use the official
  Python client library.
  The `config.load_incluster_config()` function handles API host discovery and authentication automatically.
  See an example here.

- There are a number of other libraries available, please refer to the
  Client Libraries page.

In each case, the service account credentials of the Pod are used to communicate
securely with the API server.

### Directly accessing the REST API

While running in a Pod, your container can create an HTTPS URL for the Kubernetes API
server by fetching the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` and `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS`
environment variables. The API server's in-cluster address is also published to a
Service named `kubernetes` in the `default` namespace so that pods may reference
`kubernetes.default.svc` as a DNS name for the local API server.

Kubernetes does not guarantee that the API server has a valid certificate for
the hostname `kubernetes.default.svc`;
however, the control plane **is** expected to present a valid certificate for the
hostname or IP address that `$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` represents.

The recommended way to authenticate to the API server is with a
service account
credential. By default, a Pod
is associated with a service account, and a credential (token) for that
service account is placed into the filesystem tree of each container in that Pod,
at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

If available, a certificate bundle is placed into the filesystem tree of each
container at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`, and should be
used to verify the serving certificate of the API server.

Finally, the default namespace to be used for namespaced API operations is placed in a file
at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace` in each container.

### Using kubectl proxy

If you would like to query the API without an official client library, you can run `kubectl proxy`
as the command
of a new sidecar container in the Pod. This way, `kubectl proxy` will authenticate
to the API and expose it on the `localhost` interface of the Pod, so that other containers
in the Pod can use it directly.

### Without using a proxy

It is possible to avoid using the kubectl proxy by passing the authentication token
directly to the API server. The internal certificate secures the connection.

```shell
# Point to the internal API server hostname
APISERVER=https://kubernetes.default.svc

# Path to ServiceAccount token
SERVICEACCOUNT=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

# Read this Pod's namespace
NAMESPACE=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/namespace)

# Read the ServiceAccount bearer token
TOKEN=$(cat ${SERVICEACCOUNT}/token)

# Reference the internal certificate authority (CA)
CACERT=${SERVICEACCOUNT}/ca.crt

# Explore the API with TOKEN
curl --cacert ${CACERT} --header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -X GET ${APISERVER}/api
```

The output will be similar to this:

```json
{
  "kind": "APIVersions",
  "versions": ["v1"],
  "serverAddressByClientCIDRs": [
    {
      "clientCIDR": "0.0.0.0/0",
      "serverAddress": "10.0.1.149:443"
    }
  ]
}
```
