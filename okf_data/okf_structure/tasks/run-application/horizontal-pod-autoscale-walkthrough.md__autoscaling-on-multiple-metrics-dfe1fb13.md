You can introduce additional metrics to use when autoscaling the `php-apache` Deployment
by making use of the `autoscaling/v2` API version.

First, get the YAML of your HorizontalPodAutoscaler in the `autoscaling/v2` form:

```shell
kubectl get hpa php-apache -o yaml > /tmp/hpa-v2.yaml
```

Open the `/tmp/hpa-v2.yaml` file in an editor, and you should see YAML which looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: php-apache
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: php-apache
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  lastScaleTime: <some-time>
  currentReplicas: 1
  desiredReplicas: 1
  currentMetrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      current:
        averageUtilization: 0
        averageValue: 0
```

Notice that the `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` field has been replaced with an array called `metrics`.
The CPU utilization metric is a *resource metric*, since it is represented as a percentage of a resource
specified on pod containers.  Notice that you can specify other resource metrics besides CPU.  By default,
the only other supported resource metric is `memory`.  These resources do not change names from cluster
to cluster, and should always be available, as long as the `metrics.k8s.io` API is available.

You can also specify resource metrics in terms of direct values, instead of as percentages of the
requested value, by using a `target.type` of `AverageValue` instead of `Utilization`, and
setting the corresponding `target.averageValue` field instead of the `target.averageUtilization`.

```
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 500Mi
```

There are two other types of metrics, both of which are considered *custom metrics*: pod metrics and
object metrics.  These metrics may have names which are cluster specific, and require a more
advanced cluster monitoring setup.

The first of these alternative metric types is *pod metrics*.  These metrics describe Pods, and
are averaged together across Pods and compared with a target value to determine the replica count.
They work much like resource metrics, except that they *only* support a `target` type of `AverageValue`.

Pod metrics are specified using a metric block like this:

```yaml
type: Pods
pods:
  metric:
    name: packets-per-second
  target:
    type: AverageValue
    averageValue: 1k
```

The second alternative metric type is *object metrics*. These metrics describe a different
object in the same namespace, instead of describing Pods. The metrics are not necessarily
fetched from the object; they only describe it. Object metrics support `target` types of
both `Value` and `AverageValue`.  With `Value`, the target is compared directly to the returned
metric from the API. With `AverageValue`, the value returned from the custom metrics API is divided
by the number of Pods before being compared to the target. The following example is the YAML
representation of the `requests-per-second` metric.

```yaml
type: Object
object:
  metric:
    name: requests-per-second
  describedObject:
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    name: main-route
  target:
    type: Value
    value: 2k
```

If you provide multiple such metric blocks, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler will consider each metric in turn.
The HorizontalPodAutoscaler will calculate proposed replica counts for each metric, and then choose the
one with the highest replica count.

For example, if you had your monitoring system collecting metrics about network traffic,
you could update the definition above using `kubectl edit` to look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: php-apache
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: php-apache
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
  - type: Pods
    pods:
      metric:
        name: packets-per-second
      target:
        type: AverageValue
        averageValue: 1k
  - type: Object
    object:
      metric:
        name: requests-per-second
      describedObject:
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        name: main-route
      target:
        type: Value
        value: 10k
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  lastScaleTime: <some-time>
  currentReplicas: 1
  desiredReplicas: 1
  currentMetrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
    current:
      averageUtilization: 0
      averageValue: 0
  - type: Object
    object:
      metric:
        name: requests-per-second
      describedObject:
        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Ingress
        name: main-route
      current:
        value: 10k
```

Then, your HorizontalPodAutoscaler would attempt to ensure that each pod was consuming roughly
50% of its requested CPU, serving 1000 packets per second, and that all pods behind the main-route
Ingress were serving a total of 10000 requests per second.

### Autoscaling on more specific metrics

Many metrics pipelines allow you to describe metrics either by name or by a set of additional
descriptors called _labels_. For all non-resource metric types (pod, object, and external,
described below), you can specify an additional label selector which is passed to your metric
pipeline. For instance, if you collect a metric `http_requests` with the `verb`
label, you can specify the following metric block to scale only on GET requests:

```yaml
type: Object
object:
  metric:
    name: http_requests
    selector: {matchLabels: {verb: GET}}
```

This selector uses the same syntax as the full Kubernetes label selectors. The monitoring pipeline
determines how to collapse multiple series into a single value, if the name and selector
match multiple series. The selector is additive, and cannot select metrics
that describe objects that are **not** the target object (the target pods in the case of the `Pods`
type, and the described object in the case of the `Object` type).

### Autoscaling on metrics not related to Kubernetes objects

Applications running on Kubernetes may need to autoscale based on metrics that don't have an obvious
relationship to any object in the Kubernetes cluster, such as metrics describing a hosted service with
no direct correlation to Kubernetes namespaces. In Kubernetes 1.10 and later, you can address this use case
with *external metrics*.

Using external metrics requires knowledge of your monitoring system; the setup is
similar to that required when using custom metrics. External metrics allow you to autoscale your cluster
based on any metric available in your monitoring system. Provide a `metric` block with a
`name` and `selector`, as above, and use the `External` metric type instead of `Object`.
If multiple time series are matched by the `metricSelector`,
the sum of their values is used by the HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
External metrics support both the `Value` and `AverageValue` target types, which function exactly the same
as when you use the `Object` type.

For example if your application processes tasks from a hosted queue service, you could add the following
section to your HorizontalPodAutoscaler manifest to specify that you need one worker per 30 outstanding tasks.

```yaml
- type: External
  external:
    metric:
      name: queue_messages_ready
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          queue: "worker_tasks"
    target:
      type: AverageValue
      averageValue: 30
```

When possible, it's preferable to use the custom metric target types instead of external metrics, since it's
easier for cluster administrators to secure the custom metrics API.  The external metrics API potentially allows
access to any metric, so cluster administrators should take care when exposing it.
