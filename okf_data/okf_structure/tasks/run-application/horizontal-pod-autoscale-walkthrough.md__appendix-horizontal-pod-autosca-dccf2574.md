When using the `autoscaling/v2` form of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler, you will be able to see
*status conditions* set by Kubernetes on the HorizontalPodAutoscaler.  These status conditions indicate
whether or not the HorizontalPodAutoscaler is able to scale, and whether or not it is currently restricted
in any way.

The conditions appear in the `status.conditions` field.  To see the conditions affecting a HorizontalPodAutoscaler,
we can use `kubectl describe hpa`:

```shell
kubectl describe hpa cm-test
```

```

For this HorizontalPodAutoscaler, you can see several conditions in a healthy state.  The first,
`AbleToScale`, indicates whether or not the HPA is able to fetch and update scales, as well as
whether or not any backoff-related conditions would prevent scaling.  The second, `ScalingActive`,
indicates whether or not the HPA is enabled (i.e. the replica count of the target is not zero) and
is able to calculate desired scales. When it is `False`, it generally indicates problems with
fetching metrics.  Finally, the last condition, `ScalingLimited`, indicates that the desired scale
was capped by the maximum or minimum of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler.  This is an indication that
you may wish to raise or lower the minimum or maximum replica count constraints on your
HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
