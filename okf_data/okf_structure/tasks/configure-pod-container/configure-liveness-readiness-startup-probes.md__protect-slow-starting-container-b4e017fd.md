Sometimes, you have to deal with applications that require additional startup
time on their first initialization. In such cases, it can be tricky to set up
liveness probe parameters without compromising the fast response to deadlocks
that motivated such a probe. The solution is to set up a startup probe with the
same command, HTTP or TCP check, with a `failureThreshold * periodSeconds` long
enough to cover the worst case startup time.

So, the previous example would become:

```yaml
ports:
- name: liveness-port
  containerPort: 8080

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: liveness-port
  failureThreshold: 1
  periodSeconds: 10

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: liveness-port
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

Thanks to the startup probe, the application will have a maximum of 5 minutes
(30 * 10 = 300s) to finish its startup.
Once the startup probe has succeeded once, the liveness probe takes over to
provide a fast response to container deadlocks.
If the startup probe never succeeds, the container is killed after 300s and
subject to the pod's `restartPolicy`.
