For the purposes of this walk-through, let's run some Pods.  Since you're
probably debugging your own Service you can substitute your own details, or you
can follow along and get a second data point.

```shell
kubectl create deployment hostnames --image=registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname
```
```none
deployment.apps/hostnames created
```

`kubectl` commands will print the type and name of the resource created or mutated, which can then be used in subsequent commands.

Let's scale the deployment to 3 replicas.
```shell
kubectl scale deployment hostnames --replicas=3
```
```none
deployment.apps/hostnames scaled
```

Note that this is the same as if you had started the Deployment with the following
YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hostnames
  name: hostnames
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hostnames
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hostnames
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hostnames
        image: registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname
```

The label "app" is automatically set by `kubectl create deployment` to the name of the
Deployment.

You can confirm your Pods are running:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames
```
```none
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw   1/1       Running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-ly40y   1/1       Running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-tlaok   1/1       Running   0          2m
```

You can also confirm that your Pods are serving.  You can get the list of
Pod IP addresses and test them directly.

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames \
    -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{.status.podIP}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```
```none
10.244.0.5
10.244.0.6
10.244.0.7
```

The example container used for this walk-through serves its own hostname
via HTTP on port 9376, but if you are debugging your own app, you'll want to
use whatever port number your Pods are listening on.

From within a pod:

```shell
for ep in 10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376; do
    wget -qO- $ep
done
```

This should produce something like:

```
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y
hostnames-632524106-tlaok
```

If you are not getting the responses you expect at this point, your Pods
might not be healthy or might not be listening on the port you think they are.
You might find `kubectl logs` to be useful for seeing what is happening, or
perhaps you need to `kubectl exec` directly into your Pods and debug from
there.

Assuming everything has gone to plan so far, you can start to investigate why
your Service doesn't work.
