If you get here, your Service is running, has EndpointSlices, and your Pods
are actually serving.  At this point, the whole Service proxy mechanism is
suspect.  Let's confirm it, piece by piece.

The default implementation of Services, and the one used on most clusters, is
kube-proxy.  This is a program that runs on every node and configures one of a
small set of mechanisms for providing the Service abstraction.  If your
cluster does not use kube-proxy, the following sections will not apply, and you
will have to investigate whatever implementation of Services you are using.

### Is kube-proxy running?

Confirm that `kube-proxy` is running on your Nodes.  Running directly on a
Node, you should get something like the below:

```shell
ps auxw | grep kube-proxy
```
```none
root  4194  0.4  0.1 101864 17696 ?    Sl Jul04  25:43 /usr/local/bin/kube-proxy --master=https://kubernetes-master --kubeconfig=/var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig --v=2
```

Next, confirm that it is not failing something obvious, like contacting the
master.  To do this, you'll have to look at the logs.  Accessing the logs
depends on your Node OS.  On some OSes it is a file, such as
/var/log/kube-proxy.log, while other OSes use `journalctl` to access logs.  You
should see something like:

```none

```

If you see error messages about not being able to contact the master, you
should double-check your Node configuration and installation steps.

Kube-proxy can run in one of a few modes.  In the log listed above, the
line `Using iptables Proxier` indicates that kube-proxy is running in
"iptables" mode.  The most common other mode is "ipvs".

#### Iptables mode

In "iptables" mode, you should see something like the following on a Node:

```shell
iptables-save | grep hostnames
```
```none
-A KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR -s 10.244.3.6/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.3.6:9376
-A KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ -s 10.244.1.7/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.1.7:9376
-A KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3 -s 10.244.2.3/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.2.3:9376
-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 10.0.1.175/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames: cluster IP" -m tcp --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.33332999982 -j KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50000000000 -j KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR
```

For each port of each Service, there should be 1 rule in `KUBE-SERVICES` and
one `KUBE-SVC-<hash>` chain.  For each Pod endpoint, there should be a small
number of rules in that `KUBE-SVC-<hash>` and one `KUBE-SEP-<hash>` chain with
a small number of rules in it.  The exact rules will vary based on your exact
config (including node-ports and load-balancers).

#### IPVS mode

In "ipvs" mode, you should see something like the following on a Node:

```shell
ipvsadm -ln
```
```none
Prot LocalAddress:Port Scheduler Flags
  -> RemoteAddress:Port           Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn
...
TCP  10.0.1.175:80 rr
  -> 10.244.0.5:9376               Masq    1      0          0
  -> 10.244.0.6:9376               Masq    1      0          0
  -> 10.244.0.7:9376               Masq    1      0          0
...
```

For each port of each Service, plus any NodePorts, external IPs, and
load-balancer IPs, kube-proxy will create a virtual server.  For each Pod
endpoint, it will create corresponding real servers. In this example, service
hostnames(`10.0.1.175:80`) has 3 endpoints(`10.244.0.5:9376`,
`10.244.0.6:9376`, `10.244.0.7:9376`).

### Is kube-proxy proxying?

Assuming you do see one the above cases, try again to access your Service by
IP from one of your Nodes:

```shell
curl 10.0.1.175:80
```
```none
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
```

If this still fails, look at the `kube-proxy` logs for specific lines like:

```none
Setting endpoints for default/hostnames:default to [10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376]
```

If you don't see those, try restarting `kube-proxy` with the `-v` flag set to 4, and
then look at the logs again.

### Edge case: A Pod fails to reach itself via the Service IP {#a-pod-fails-to-reach-itself-via-the-service-ip}

This might sound unlikely, but it does happen and it is supposed to work.

This can happen when the network is not properly configured for "hairpin"
traffic, usually when `kube-proxy` is running in `iptables` mode and Pods
are connected with bridge network. The `Kubelet` exposes a `hairpin-mode`
flag that allows endpoints of a Service to loadbalance
back to themselves if they try to access their own Service VIP. The
`hairpin-mode` flag must either be set to `hairpin-veth` or
`promiscuous-bridge`.

The common steps to trouble shoot this are as follows:

* Confirm `hairpin-mode` is set to `hairpin-veth` or `promiscuous-bridge`.
You should see something like the below. `hairpin-mode` is set to
`promiscuous-bridge` in the following example.

```shell
ps auxw | grep kubelet
```
```none
root      3392  1.1  0.8 186804 65208 ?        Sl   00:51  11:11 /usr/local/bin/kubelet --enable-debugging-handlers=true --config=/etc/kubernetes/manifests --allow-privileged=True --v=4 --cluster-dns=10.0.0.10 --cluster-domain=cluster.local --configure-cbr0=true --cgroup-root=/ --system-cgroups=/system --hairpin-mode=promiscuous-bridge --runtime-cgroups=/docker-daemon --kubelet-cgroups=/kubelet --babysit-daemons=true --max-pods=110 --serialize-image-pulls=false --outofdisk-transition-frequency=0
```

* Confirm the effective `hairpin-mode`. To do this, you'll have to look at
kubelet log. Accessing the logs depends on your Node OS. On some OSes it
is a file, such as /var/log/kubelet.log, while other OSes use `journalctl`
to access logs. Please be noted that the effective hairpin mode may not
match `--hairpin-mode` flag due to compatibility. Check if there is any log
lines with key word `hairpin` in kubelet.log. There should be log lines
indicating the effective hairpin mode, like something below.

```none
I0629 00:51:43.648698    3252 kubelet.go:380] Hairpin mode set to "promiscuous-bridge"
```

* If the effective hairpin mode is `hairpin-veth`, ensure the `Kubelet` has
the permission to operate in `/sys` on node. If everything works properly,
you should see something like:

```shell
for intf in /sys/devices/virtual/net/cbr0/brif/*; do cat $intf/hairpin_mode; done
```
```none
1
1
1
1
```

* If the effective hairpin mode is `promiscuous-bridge`, ensure `Kubelet`
has the permission to manipulate linux bridge on node. If `cbr0` bridge is
used and configured properly, you should see:

```shell
ifconfig cbr0 |grep PROMISC
```
```none
UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1460  Metric:1
```

* Seek help if none of above works out.
