It might sound silly, but you should really double and triple check that your
Service is correct and matches your Pod's port.  Read back your Service
and verify it:

```shell
kubectl get service hostnames -o json
```
```json
{
    "kind": "Service",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "hostnames",
        "namespace": "default",
        "uid": "428c8b6c-24bc-11e5-936d-42010af0a9bc",
        "resourceVersion": "347189",
        "creationTimestamp": "2015-07-07T15:24:29Z",
        "labels": {
            "app": "hostnames"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "ports": [
            {
                "name": "default",
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "port": 80,
                "targetPort": 9376,
                "nodePort": 0
            }
        ],
        "selector": {
            "app": "hostnames"
        },
        "clusterIP": "10.0.1.175",
        "type": "ClusterIP",
        "sessionAffinity": "None"
    },
    "status": {
        "loadBalancer": {}
    }
}
```

* Is the Service port you are trying to access listed in `spec.ports[]`?
* Is the `targetPort` correct for your Pods (some Pods use a different port than the Service)?
* If you meant to use a numeric port, is it a number (9376) or a string "9376"?
* If you meant to use a named port, do your Pods expose a port with the same name?
* Is the port's `protocol` correct for your Pods?
