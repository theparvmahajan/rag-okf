For this example we'll use a Deployment to create two pods, similar to the earlier example.

Create deployment by running following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx-with-request.yaml
```

```none
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

Check pod status by following command:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

```none
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-67d4bdd6f5-cx2nz   1/1     Running   0          13s
nginx-deployment-67d4bdd6f5-w6kd7   1/1     Running   0          13s
```

We can retrieve a lot more information about each of these pods using `kubectl describe pod`. For example:

```shell
kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-67d4bdd6f5-w6kd7
```

```none

Here you can see configuration information about the container(s) and Pod (labels, resource requirements, etc.), as well as status information about the container(s) and Pod (state, readiness, restart count, events, etc.).

The container state is one of Waiting, Running, or Terminated. Depending on the state, additional information will be provided - here you can see that for a container in Running state, the system tells you when the container started.

Ready tells you whether the container passed its last readiness probe. (In this case, the container does not have a readiness probe configured; the container is assumed to be ready if no readiness probe is configured.)

Restart Count tells you how many times the container has been restarted; this information can be useful for detecting crash loops in containers that are configured with a restart policy of `Always`.

Currently the only Condition associated with a Pod is the binary Ready condition, which indicates that the pod is able to service requests and should be added to the load balancing pools of all matching services.

Lastly, you see a log of recent events related to your Pod. "From" indicates the component that is logging the event. "Reason" and "Message" tell you what happened.
