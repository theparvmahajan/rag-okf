This is an incomplete list of things that could go wrong, and how to adjust your cluster setup to mitigate the problems.

### Contributing causes

- VM(s) shutdown
- Network partition within cluster, or between cluster and users
- Crashes in Kubernetes software
- Data loss or unavailability of persistent storage (e.g. GCE PD or AWS EBS volume)
- Operator error, for example, misconfigured Kubernetes software or application software

### Specific scenarios

- API server VM shutdown or apiserver crashing
  - Results
    - unable to stop, update, or start new pods, services, replication controller
    - existing pods and services should continue to work normally unless they depend on the Kubernetes API
- API server backing storage lost
  - Results
    - the kube-apiserver component fails to start successfully and become healthy
    - kubelets will not be able to reach it but will continue to run the same pods and provide the same service proxying
    - manual recovery or recreation of apiserver state necessary before apiserver is restarted
- Supporting services (node controller, replication controller manager, scheduler, etc) VM shutdown or crashes
  - currently those are colocated with the apiserver, and their unavailability has similar consequences as apiserver
  - in future, these will be replicated as well and may not be co-located
  - they do not have their own persistent state
- Individual node (VM or physical machine) shuts down
  - Results
    - pods on that Node stop running
- Network partition
  - Results
    - partition A thinks the nodes in partition B are down; partition B thinks the apiserver is down.
      (Assuming the master VM ends up in partition A.)
- Kubelet software fault
  - Results
    - crashing kubelet cannot start new pods on the node
    - kubelet might delete the pods or not
    - node marked unhealthy
    - replication controllers start new pods elsewhere
- Cluster operator error
  - Results
    - loss of pods, services, etc
    - lost of apiserver backing store
    - users unable to read API
    - etc.

### Mitigations

- Action: Use the IaaS provider's automatic VM restarting feature for IaaS VMs
  - Mitigates: Apiserver VM shutdown or apiserver crashing
  - Mitigates: Supporting services VM shutdown or crashes

- Action: Use IaaS providers reliable storage (e.g. GCE PD or AWS EBS volume) for VMs with apiserver+etcd
  - Mitigates: Apiserver backing storage lost

- Action: Use high-availability configuration
  - Mitigates: Control plane node shutdown or control plane components (scheduler, API server, controller-manager) crashing
    - Will tolerate one or more simultaneous node or component failures
  - Mitigates: API server backing storage (i.e., etcd's data directory) lost
    - Assumes HA (highly-available) etcd configuration

- Action: Snapshot apiserver PDs/EBS-volumes periodically
  - Mitigates: Apiserver backing storage lost
  - Mitigates: Some cases of operator error
  - Mitigates: Some cases of Kubernetes software fault

- Action: use replication controller and services in front of pods
  - Mitigates: Node shutdown
  - Mitigates: Kubelet software fault

- Action: applications (containers) designed to tolerate unexpected restarts
  - Mitigates: Node shutdown
  - Mitigates: Kubelet software fault
