In this exercise, you create a Pod that runs two Containers. The two containers
share a Volume that they can use to communicate. Here is the configuration file
for the Pod:

In the configuration file, you can see that the Pod has a Volume named
`shared-data`.

The first container listed in the configuration file runs an nginx server. The
mount path for the shared Volume is `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
The second container is based on the debian image, and has a mount path of
`/pod-data`. The second container runs the following command and then terminates.

    echo Hello from the debian container > /pod-data/index.html

Notice that the second container writes the `index.html` file in the root
directory of the nginx server.

Create the Pod and the two Containers:

    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/two-container-pod.yaml

View information about the Pod and the Containers:

    kubectl get pod two-containers --output=yaml

Here is a portion of the output:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      ...
      name: two-containers
      namespace: default
      ...
    spec:
      ...
      containerStatuses:

      - containerID: docker://c1d8abd1 ...
        image: debian
        ...
        lastState:
          terminated:
            ...
        name: debian-container
        ...

      - containerID: docker://96c1ff2c5bb ...
        image: nginx
        ...
        name: nginx-container
        ...
        state:
          running:
        ...

You can see that the debian Container has terminated, and the nginx Container
is still running.

Get a shell to nginx Container:

    kubectl exec -it two-containers -c nginx-container -- /bin/bash

In your shell, verify that nginx is running:

    root@two-containers:/# apt-get update
    root@two-containers:/# apt-get install curl procps
    root@two-containers:/# ps aux

The output is similar to this:

    USER       PID  ...  STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root         1  ...  Ss   21:12   0:00 nginx: master process nginx -g daemon off;

Recall that the debian Container created the `index.html` file in the nginx root
directory. Use `curl` to send a GET request to the nginx server:

```
root@two-containers:/# curl localhost
```

The output shows that nginx serves a web page written by the debian container:

```
Hello from the debian container
```
