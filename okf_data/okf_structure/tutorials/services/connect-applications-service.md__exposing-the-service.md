For some parts of your applications you may want to expose a Service onto an
external IP address. Kubernetes supports two ways of doing this: NodePorts and
LoadBalancers. The Service created in the last section already used `NodePort`,
so your nginx HTTPS replica is ready to serve traffic on the internet if your
node has a public IP.

```shell
kubectl get svc my-nginx -o yaml | grep nodePort -C 5
  uid: 07191fb3-f61a-11e5-8ae5-42010af00002
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.0.162.149
  ports:
  - name: http
    nodePort: 31704
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  - name: https
    nodePort: 32453
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 443
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
```
```shell
kubectl get nodes -o yaml | grep ExternalIP -C 1
    - address: 104.197.41.11
      type: ExternalIP
    allocatable:
--
    - address: 23.251.152.56
      type: ExternalIP
    allocatable:
...

$ curl https://<EXTERNAL-IP>:<NODE-PORT> -k
...
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
```

Let's now recreate the Service to use a cloud load balancer.
Change the `Type` of `my-nginx` Service from `NodePort` to `LoadBalancer`:

```shell
kubectl edit svc my-nginx
kubectl get svc my-nginx
```
```
NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)               AGE
my-nginx   LoadBalancer   10.0.162.149     xx.xxx.xxx.xxx     8080:30163/TCP        21s
```
```
curl https://<EXTERNAL-IP> -k
...
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
```

The IP address in the `EXTERNAL-IP` column is the one that is available on the public internet.
The `CLUSTER-IP` is only available inside your cluster/private cloud network.

Note that on AWS, type `LoadBalancer` creates an ELB, which uses a (long)
hostname, not an IP.  It's too long to fit in the standard `kubectl get svc`
output, in fact, so you'll need to do `kubectl describe service my-nginx` to
see it.  You'll see something like this:

```shell
kubectl describe service my-nginx
...
LoadBalancer Ingress:   a320587ffd19711e5a37606cf4a74574-1142138393.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
...
```
