A stacked HA cluster is a topology where the distributed
data storage cluster provided by etcd is stacked on top of the cluster formed by the nodes managed by
kubeadm that run control plane components.

Each control plane node runs an instance of the `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, and `kube-controller-manager`.
The `kube-apiserver` is exposed to worker nodes using a load balancer.

Each control plane node creates a local etcd member and this etcd member communicates only with
the `kube-apiserver` of this node. The same applies to the local `kube-controller-manager`
and `kube-scheduler` instances.

This topology couples the control planes and etcd members on the same nodes. It is simpler to set up than a cluster
with external etcd nodes, and simpler to manage for replication.

However, a stacked cluster runs the risk of failed coupling. If one node goes down, both an etcd member and a control
plane instance are lost, and redundancy is compromised. You can mitigate this risk by adding more control plane nodes.

You should therefore run a minimum of three stacked control plane nodes for an HA cluster.

This is the default topology in kubeadm. A local etcd member is created automatically
on control plane nodes when using `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join --control-plane`.
