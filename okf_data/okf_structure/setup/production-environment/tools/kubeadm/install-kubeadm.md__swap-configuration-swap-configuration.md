The default behavior of a kubelet is to fail to start if swap memory is detected on a node.
This means that swap should either be disabled or tolerated by kubelet.

* To tolerate swap, add `failSwapOn: false` to kubelet configuration or as a command line argument.
  Note: even if `failSwapOn: false` is provided, workloads wouldn't have swap access by default.
  This can be changed by setting a `swapBehavior`, again in the kubelet configuration file. To use swap,
  set a `swapBehavior` other than the default `NoSwap` setting.
  See Swap memory management for more details.
* To disable swap, `sudo swapoff -a` can be used to disable swapping temporarily.
  To make this change persistent across reboots, make sure swap is disabled in
  config files like `/etc/fstab`, `systemd.swap`, depending how it was configured on your system.
