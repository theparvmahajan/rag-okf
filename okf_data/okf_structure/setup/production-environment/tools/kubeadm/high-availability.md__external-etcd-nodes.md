Setting up a cluster with external etcd nodes is similar to the procedure used for stacked etcd
with the exception that you should setup etcd first, and you should pass the etcd information
in the kubeadm config file.

### Set up the etcd cluster

1. Follow these instructions to set up the etcd cluster.

1. Set up SSH as described here.

1. Copy the following files from any etcd node in the cluster to the first control plane node:

   ```sh
   export CONTROL_PLANE="ubuntu@10.0.0.7"
   scp /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt "${CONTROL_PLANE}":
   scp /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt "${CONTROL_PLANE}":
   scp /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key "${CONTROL_PLANE}":
   ```

   - Replace the value of `CONTROL_PLANE` with the `user@host` of the first control-plane node.

### Set up the first control plane node

1. Create a file called `kubeadm-config.yaml` with the following contents:

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
   kind: ClusterConfiguration
   kubernetesVersion: stable
   controlPlaneEndpoint: "LOAD_BALANCER_DNS:LOAD_BALANCER_PORT" # change this (see below)
   etcd:
     external:
       endpoints:
         - https://ETCD_0_IP:2379 # change ETCD_0_IP appropriately
         - https://ETCD_1_IP:2379 # change ETCD_1_IP appropriately
         - https://ETCD_2_IP:2379 # change ETCD_2_IP appropriately
       caFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt
       certFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.crt
       keyFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-etcd-client.key
   ```

   
   The difference between stacked etcd and external etcd here is that the external etcd setup requires
   a configuration file with the etcd endpoints under the `external` object for `etcd`.
   In the case of the stacked etcd topology, this is managed automatically.
   

   - Replace the following variables in the config template with the appropriate values for your cluster:

     - `LOAD_BALANCER_DNS`
     - `LOAD_BALANCER_PORT`
     - `ETCD_0_IP`
     - `ETCD_1_IP`
     - `ETCD_2_IP`

The following steps are similar to the stacked etcd setup:

1. Run `sudo kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml --upload-certs` on this node.

1. Write the output join commands that are returned to a text file for later use.

1. Apply the CNI plugin of your choice.

   
   You must pick a network plugin that suits your use case and deploy it before you move on to next step.
   If you don't do this, you will not be able to launch your cluster properly.
   

### Steps for the rest of the control plane nodes

The steps are the same as for the stacked etcd setup:

- Make sure the first control plane node is fully initialized.
- Join each control plane node with the join command you saved to a text file. It's recommended
  to join the control plane nodes one at a time.
- Don't forget that the decryption key from `--certificate-key` expires after two hours, by default.
