The `Workload` API resource defines the scheduling requirements and structure of a multi-Pod
application. While workload controllers such as Job
manage the application's runtime state, the `Workload` specifies how groups of `Pods`
should be scheduled. The Job controller is the only built-in controller that creates
PodGroup objects from the `Workload`'s
`PodGroupTemplates` at runtime.

## What is a Workload?

The Workload API resource is part of the `scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha2`
API group
and your cluster must have that API group enabled, as well as the `GenericWorkload`
feature gate,
before you can use this API.

A `Workload` is a static, long-lived policy template. It defines what scheduling
policies should be applied to groups of Pods, but does not track runtime state itself.
Runtime scheduling state is maintained by PodGroup
objects, which controllers create from the `Workload`'s `PodGroupTemplates`.

## API structure

A `Workload` consists of two fields: a list of `PodGroupTemplates` and an optional controller
reference. The entire `Workload` spec is immutable after creation: you cannot modify
existing templates, add new templates, or remove templates from `podGroupTemplates`.

### PodGroupTemplates

The `spec.podGroupTemplates` list defines the distinct components of your workload.
For example, a machine learning job might have a `driver` template and a `worker` template.

Each entry in `podGroupTemplates` must have:
1. A unique `name` that will be used to reference the template in the `PodGroup`'s `spec.podGroupTemplateRef`.
2. A scheduling policy (`basic` or `gang`).

If the `WorkloadAwarePreemption` feature gate is enabled each entry in `podGroups` can also have priority and disruption mode.

The maximum number of PodGroupTemplates in a single Workload is 8.

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: training-job-workload
  namespace: some-ns
spec:
  controllerRef:
    apiGroup: batch
    kind: Job
    name: training-job
  podGroupTemplates:
  - name: workers
    schedulingPolicy:
      gang:
        # The gang is schedulable only if 4 pods can run at once
        minCount: 4
    priorityClassName: high-priority # Only applicable with WorkloadAwarePreemption feature gate
    disruptionMode: PodGroup # Only applicable with WorkloadAwarePreemption feature gate
```

When a workload controller creates a `PodGroup` from one of these templates, it copies the
`schedulingPolicy` into the `PodGroup`'s own spec. Changes to the `Workload` only affect
newly created `PodGroups`, not existing ones.

### Referencing a workload controlling object

The `controllerRef` field links the Workload back to the specific high-level object defining the application,
such as a Job or a custom CRD. This is useful for observability and tooling.
This data is not used to schedule or manage the Workload.

## Gang scheduling with Jobs

When the
`WorkloadWithJob`
feature gate is enabled, the
Job controller automatically
creates Workload and PodGroup objects for parallel indexed Jobs where
`.spec.parallelism` equals `.spec.completions`. The gang policy's `minCount`
is set to the Job's parallelism, so all Pods must be schedulable together
before any of them are bound to nodes.

This is the built-in path for using gang scheduling with Jobs.
You do not need to create Workload or PodGroup objects yourself as the Job
controller handles it automatically. Other workload controllers (such as
JobSet) may manage their own Workload and PodGroup objects independently.
