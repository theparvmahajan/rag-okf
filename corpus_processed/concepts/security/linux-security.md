This page describes security considerations and best practices specific to the Linux operating system.

## Protection for Secret data on nodes

On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as `secret`
volume mounts, or `emptyDir` with `medium: Memory`)
are implemented with a `tmpfs` filesystem.

If you have swap configured and use an older Linux kernel (or a current kernel and an unsupported configuration of Kubernetes),
**memory** backed volumes can have data written to persistent storage.

The Linux kernel officially supports the `noswap` option from version 6.3,
therefore it is recommended the used kernel version is 6.3 or later,
or supports the `noswap` option via a backport, if swap is enabled on the node.
