This page shows how to define environment variables for a container
in a Kubernetes Pod.

## Prerequisites

## Define an environment variable for a container

When you create a Pod, you can set environment variables for the containers
that run in the Pod. To set environment variables, include the `env` or
`envFrom` field in the configuration file.

The `env` and `envFrom` fields have different effects.

`env`
: allows you to set environment variables for a container, specifying a value directly for each variable that you name.

`envFrom`
: allows you to set environment variables for a container by referencing either a ConfigMap or a Secret.
 When you use `envFrom`, all the key-value pairs in the referenced ConfigMap or Secret
 are set as environment variables for the container.
 You can also specify a common prefix string.

You can read more about ConfigMap
and Secret.

This page explains how to use `env`.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that runs one container. The configuration
file for the Pod defines an environment variable with name `DEMO_GREETING` and
value `"Hello from the environment"`. Here is the configuration manifest for the
Pod:

1. Create a Pod based on that manifest:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/envars.yaml
   ```

1. List the running Pods:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods -l purpose=demonstrate-envars
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   envar-demo      1/1       Running   0          9s
   ```

1. List the Pod's container environment variables:

   ```shell
   kubectl exec envar-demo -- printenv
   ```

   The output is similar to this:

   ```
   NODE_VERSION=4.4.2
   EXAMPLE_SERVICE_PORT_8080_TCP_ADDR=10.3.245.237
   HOSTNAME=envar-demo
   ...
   DEMO_GREETING=Hello from the environment
   DEMO_FAREWELL=Such a sweet sorrow
   ```

The environment variables set using the `env` or `envFrom` field
override any environment variables specified in the container image.

Environment variables may reference each other, however ordering is important.
Variables making use of others defined in the same context must come later in
the list. Similarly, avoid circular references.

## Using environment variables inside of your config

Environment variables that you define in a Pod's configuration under 
`.spec.containers[*].env[*]` can be used elsewhere in the configuration, for 
example in commands and arguments that you set for the Pod's containers.
In the example configuration below, the `GREETING`, `HONORIFIC`, and
`NAME` environment variables are set to `Warm greetings to`, `The Most
Honorable`, and `Kubernetes`, respectively. The environment variable 
`MESSAGE` combines the set of all these environment variables and then uses it 
as a CLI argument passed to the `env-print-demo` container.

Environment variable names may consist of any printable ASCII characters except '='.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: env-print-demo
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING
      value: "Warm greetings to"
    - name: HONORIFIC
      value: "The Most Honorable"
    - name: NAME
      value: "Kubernetes"
    - name: MESSAGE
      value: "$(GREETING) $(HONORIFIC) $(NAME)"
    command: ["echo"]
    args: ["$(MESSAGE)"]
```

Upon creation, the command `echo Warm greetings to The Most Honorable Kubernetes` is run on the container.
